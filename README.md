This is a game of 3 biological elements: antibiotics, bacteria, and a virus

Antibiotics can eat bacteria and the virus while the virus can eat bacteria.

Antibiotics have a lifeTime which decreases if they do not eat enough

The bacteria use genetic algorithm to evolve over time and evade the antibiotic class

The player's goal is to control the virus using mouse, and try to evade antibiotics,

and at the same time eat as many bacteria as possible trying to slow down their evolution

once antibiotics die the game will be over, and the score of the virus will be stored

Note: if its the best score it will be stored in a file and displayed on the screen
